# `.claude/` — Claude Code config

Defaults shipped by this repo. See the [top-level README](../README.md) for install and usage.

## Layout

```
.claude/
  README.md                           # this file (inventory + conventions)
  claude-defaults.md                  # @-imported from CLAUDE.md → loaded every session
  potential-bugs.md                   # append-only sink for deep-bug-scan
  techdebt.md                         # rolling backlog for /techdebt (deferred items only)
  settings.json                       # team-shared permissions (checked in)
  settings.local.json                 # per-machine overrides (gitignored)
  settings.mempalace.example.json     # opt-in mempalace MCP + hooks
  agents/                             # subagents (one .md per agent, YAML frontmatter)
  commands/                           # slash commands (one .md per command, no frontmatter)
```

> Don't put a `README.md` inside `commands/` — Claude Code registers every `.md` there as a slash command, so a README becomes `/README`.

## Agents

| Agent             | Model  | Purpose                                                                                    | Invoked by commands                           |
| ----------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `build-validator` | Sonnet | Typecheck / lint / test / build. `--deep` = clean-install + sequenced unit→integration→e2e | `/verify`                                     |
| `code-architect`  | Opus   | Staff-level review of staged + unstaged changes                                            | `/plan-review`                                |
| `deep-bug-scan`   | Opus   | Scans a folder for logic / null / async / SQL / assertion bugs                             | `/scan`                                       |
| `oncall-guide`    | Sonnet | Diagnoses test or CI failures and classifies the cause                                     | `/verify` (on failure)                        |
| `stack-navigator` | Sonnet | Reads `gh stack view` and proposes the next safe action                                    | `/stack` (no args)                            |

Recently-changed-code cleanup uses the **built-in** `/simplify` skill (a Claude Code built-in, not a command this repo ships) — no custom agent needed.

## Commands

One `.md` per command in `.claude/commands/`. Filename (minus `.md`) is the command name: `grill.md` → `/grill`. No frontmatter. Use `$ARGUMENTS` inside the file to reference text typed after the command.

| Command        | What it does                                                               | Dispatches agents             |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `/acp`         | Stage, commit with a generated message, push (stack-aware)                 | —                             |
| `/boris`       | Boris Cherny's workflow tips & best practices                              | —                             |
| `/grill`       | Grill your own diff — correctness, concurrency, edge cases                 | —                             |
| `/plan-review` | Write a plan, then spin up a reviewer before implementation                | code-architect                |
| `/rabbit`      | CodeRabbit review on the current branch against `main`                     | —                             |
| `/save`        | Persist durable context (+ mempalace if installed), then compact           | —                             |
| `/scan [dir]`  | Deep bug scan; appends findings to `potential-bugs.md`                     | deep-bug-scan                 |
| `/stack`       | gh-stack wrapper. Bare call = smart recommendation                         | stack-navigator (no args)     |
| `/techdebt`    | Scan for duplication, dead code, low-value abstractions; defer/apply/reject per item. Deferred items go to `techdebt.md` (rolling backlog, dedupes against prior runs). | — |
| `/verify`      | Pre-PR gate. `--deep` = full install + sequenced unit→int→e2e              | build-validator, oncall-guide |

## Commands vs skills

Claude Code has two distinct mechanisms. This repo uses **commands**.

- **Commands** (`.claude/commands/foo.md`) — invoked only when the user types `/foo`. No frontmatter. Best for explicit checkpoints.
- **Skills** (`.claude/skills/foo/SKILL.md` with `name` + `description` frontmatter) — Claude can auto-invoke via the `Skill` tool when the description matches user intent. Use only if you want proactive invocation.

Everything here is an explicit user action (commit, verify, grill, scan) — don't promote to skills unless auto-triggering is genuinely desired.

## Conventions when editing files here

- **Agents** use YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`, optional `model`, `isolation`). `description` is what Claude Code matches on — write it as a triggerable purpose, not a title.
- **Commands** don't use frontmatter. Filename is the command name.
- When you add or remove an agent/command, update both inventories: this file and the top-level `README.md`.
- Keep files short. Front-loaded, declarative instructions beat verbose prose.
- `deep-bug-scan` appends findings to `potential-bugs.md` and must dedupe against existing entries.
- `/techdebt` writes only **deferred** findings to `techdebt.md` — it's a rolling backlog, not a log. Items fixed or rejected in a session must be removed from the file.
- After adding/moving/renaming commands or agents, restart Claude Code (`/exit`, then `claude`) and verify they register without a `skills:` prefix.
