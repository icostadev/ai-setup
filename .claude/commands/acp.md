Stage all changes, create a commit with a descriptive message, and push to the remote. Stack-aware.

## Steps

1. Run `git status` and `git diff` to review the working tree before staging anything.
2. `git add -A` to stage all changes.
3. Write a concise, descriptive commit message based on the changes. If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided, use it verbatim as the commit message instead.
4. Commit.
5. **Decide how to push:**
   - If `.git/gh-stack` exists (current branch is part of a gh-stack), run `gh stack push` — it uses `--force-with-lease --atomic` and preserves stack metadata.
   - Otherwise, `git push` on the current branch (add `-u origin <branch>` if the branch has no upstream).
6. Report the commit SHA and, for stacked branches, the PR URL from `gh stack view`.

## Guardrails

- Never use `git push --force` or `-f`. In stacked context, `gh stack push` handles force-with-lease correctly.
- If the working tree has only whitespace or generated-file changes, ask before committing.
- Skip files that look like secrets (`.env*`, `*.pem`, credentials files) — warn if the user explicitly staged them.
